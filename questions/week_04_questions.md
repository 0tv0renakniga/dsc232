### Question 5
**15 / 15 pts**

What was the average **Value** of **TOBS Measurement** for station **USC00081046** in the **Year 1945**?

> **Note:** You need to use the `unpackAndScale()` function from `lib/numpy_pack.py` to get the values and then the `np.nanmean()` function to get the average.

### Question 6
**15 / 15 pts**

Let $\vec{u}_1, \vec{u}_2$ be unit vectors that are orthogonal to each other.

* **Correct answer:** -3 (with margin: 0)

---

### Question 7
**15 / 15 pts**

Let $\vec{u}_1, \vec{u}_2$ be unit vectors that are orthogonal to each other. Let $\vec{v}=2\vec{u}_1-2\vec{u}_2$.
What is $\|\vec{v}\|_2$?

* **Correct answer:** 2.8284 (with margin: 0.1)
