# Milestone 1
## Abstract, Data, and Group Selection
### Description
- Abstract submission is worth 10 points out of 100. If you do can not create your own group, you will be randomly assigned one. A signup sheet for those of you that would like to be randomly assigned has been made available. See above.

- Please submit your abstract along with a short description of your data, and a link to your data, as well as a list of your partners and their UCSD emails. Any deviation from this will result in a loss of points. Make sure you chose a dataset that does not have what you would like to do already published. If we see that there is overlap in what you would like to do with the project, it will be rejected.

- All late submissions and rejected abstracts will not be awarded credit, but we will allow you to resubmit late for review only and not for credit. A different late credit assignment for the 1st milestone will be released after the due date for review purposes only. You must have your abstract approved before submitting subsequent milestones.

- The abstract should be one paragraph. Please do not write more than one paragraph. You can find more information on how to create an abstract [here](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/academic-writing/write-an-abstract/). You are also welcome to look at abstract examples on Google Scholar or Web of Science.
