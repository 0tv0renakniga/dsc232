# use these tips for week 2
## step 1
1. Syllabus (one-time, for context)
2. Week 1 guide (the LaTeX lecture notes you have)
3. Week 1 quiz questions + your notes on what was hard
4. Week 2 guide (new material)

## step 2
"Using FORENSIC ANALYSIS mode:

1. Analyze the GAP between Week 1 guide and Week 1 quiz
   - What was in quiz but NOT in guide?
   - What depth level was tested vs taught?
   - What terminology shifted?

2. Build a SHADOW SYLLABUS for Week 2
   - Based on Week 1 patterns, what will Week 2 quiz likely test?
   - What prerequisites are assumed but not taught?
   - What "mentioned in passing" topics are high-risk?

3. Create an ENHANCED Week 2 study guide that covers:
   - Official material (from Week 2 guide)
   - Gap-filling material (prerequisites, comparative analysis, "why" explanations)
   - Predicted exam traps based on Week 1 patterns

4. Generate practice questions at 1.5x difficulty in the professor's style"

## step NOW
I'm taking DSC 232R with a professor who has a severe teach-test mismatch. 

WEEK 1 FORENSIC ANALYSIS:
- Attached: Week 1 lecture guide (what was taught)
- Attached: Week 1 quiz questions (what was tested)
- Attached: Course syllabus (official curriculum)

TASKS:
1. Analyze the GAP:
   - What concepts appeared on quiz but were barely/not covered in guide?
   - What depth was tested vs. taught? (surface vs. deep)
   - What terminology differences exist?
   - What prerequisites were assumed?

2. Build PROFESSOR PROFILE:
   - What's this professor's testing philosophy based on Week 1?
   - What are their favorite question types?
   - What topics do they gloss over in lecture but test deeply?

3. Create WEEK 2 BATTLE PLAN:
   - I have the Week 2 guide. Based on Week 1 patterns, what ELSE do I need to study?
   - What "shadow topics" should I research that won't be in the guide?
   - Generate 10 practice questions in this professor's style for Week 2 content

4. SURVIVAL STRATEGY:
   - Going forward, what should I do EVERY week to avoid being blindsided?
