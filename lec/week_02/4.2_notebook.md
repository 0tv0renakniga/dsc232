# Operations on (key,val) RDDs

## Types of spark operations

There are Three types of operations on RDDs: Transformations, Actions and Shuffles.

* The most expensive operations are those the require communication between nodes.

### Transformations: RDD $\rightarrow$ RDD.

* Examples map, filter, sample, More
* No communication needed.

### Actions: RDD $\rightarrow$ Python-object in head node.

* Examples: reduce, collect, count, take, More
* Some communication needed.
### Shuffles: RDD $\rightarrow$ RDD, shuffle needed

* Examples: sort, distinct, repartition, sortByKey, reduceByKey, join More
* A LOT of communication might be needed.

## Key/value pairs

* A python dictionary is a collection of key/value pairs.
* The key is used to find a set of pairs with the particular key.
* The value can be anything.
* Spark has a set of special operations for (key,value) RDDs.

Spark provides specific functions to deal with RDDs in which each element is a key/value pair. Key/value RDDs expose new operations (e.g. aggregating and grouping together data with the same key and grouping together two different RDDs.) Such RDDs are also called pair RDDs. In python, each element of a pair RDD is a pair tuple.

```python
import os
os.environ["PYSPARK_PYTHON"]="python3"
os.environ["PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON"] = "python3"

from pyspark import SparkContext
sc = SparkContext(master="local[4]")
```

## Creating (key,value) RDDS

### Method 1: `parallelize` a list of pairs.

```python
pair_rdd = sc.parallelize([(1,2), (3,4)])
print(pair_rdd.collect())

# RETURNS
# -> [(1, 2), (3, 4)]
```

### Method 2: `map` a function that maps elements to key/value pairs.

```python
regular_rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6])
pair_rdd = regular_rdd.map( lambda x: (x, x*x) )
print(pair_rdd.collect())

# RETURNS
# -> [(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (2, 4), (5, 25), (6, 36)]
```

## Transformations on (key,value) rdds

### `reduceByKey(func)`

Apply the reduce function on the values with the same key.

```python
rdd = sc.parallelize([(1,2), (2,4), (2,6)])
print("Original RDD :", rdd.collect())
print("After transformation : ", rdd.reduceByKey(lambda a,b: a+b).collect())

# RETURNS
# -> 
"""
Original RDD : [(1, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6)]
After transformation :  [(1, 2), (2, 10)]
"""
```

### `sortByKey()`

Sort RDD by keys in ascending order.

```python
rdd = sc.parallelize([(2,2), (1,4), (3,6)])
print("Original RDD :", rdd.collect())
print("After transformation : ", rdd.sortByKey().collect())

# RETURNS
# ->
"""
Original RDD : [(2, 2), (1, 4), (3, 6)]
After transformation :  [(1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 6)]
"""
```

Note: The output of sortByKey() is an RDD. This means that RDDs do have a meaningful order, which extends between partitions.

### `mapValues(func)`

Apply func to each value of RDD without changing the key.

```python
rdd = sc.parallelize([(1,2), (2,4), (2,6)])
print("Original RDD :", rdd.collect())
print("After transformation : ", rdd.mapValues(lambda x: x*2).collect())

# RETURNS
# ->
"""
Original RDD : [(1, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6)]
After transformation :  [(1, 4), (2, 8), (2, 12)]
"""
```

### `groupByKey()`

Returns a new RDD of `(key,<iterator>)` pairs where the iterator iterates over the values associated with the key.


`Iterators` are python objects that generate a sequence of values. Writing a loop over `n` elements as

```python
for i in range(n):
    ## do something...
```

is inefficient because it first allocates a list of `n` elements and then iterates over it. Using the iterator `xrange(n)` achieves the same result without materializing the list. Instead, elements are generated on the fly.

To materialize the list of values returned by an iterator we will use the list comprehension command:

```python
[i for i in list]
```

```python
rdd = sc.parallelize([(1,2), (2,4), (2,6)])
print("Original RDD :", rdd.collect())
print("After transformation : ", rdd.groupByKey().mapValues(lambda x:[a for a in x]).collect())

# RETURNS
# ->
"""
Original RDD : [(1, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6)]
After transformation :  [(1, [2]), (2, [4, 6])]
"""
```

### `flatMapValues(func)`

Similar to `flatMap()`: creates a separate key/value pair for each element of the list generated by the map operation.

func is a function that takes as input a single value and returns an iterator that generates a sequence of values. The application of flatMapValues operates on a key/value RDD. It applies `func`to each value, and gets an list (generated by the iterator) of values. It then combines each of the values with the original key to produce a list of key-value pairs. These lists are concatenated as in `flatMap`

```python
rdd = sc.parallelize([(1,2), (2,4), (2,6)])
print("Original RDD :", rdd.collect())
# the lambda function generates for each number i, an iterator that produces i,i+1
print("After transformation : ", rdd.flatMapValues(lambda x: list(range(x,x+2))).collect())

# RETURNS
# ->
"""
Original RDD : [(1, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6)]
After transformation :  [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7)]
"""
```

### (Advanced) `combineByKey(createCombiner, mergeValue, mergeCombiner)`

Combine values with the same key using a different result type.

This is the most general of the per-key aggregation functions. Most of the other per-key combiners are implemented using it.

The elements of the original RDD are considered here values

Values are converted into combiners which we will refer to here as "accumulators". An example of such a mapping is the mapping of the value word to the accumulator (word,1) that is done in WordCount.

accumulators are then combined with values and the other combiner to generate a result for each key.

For example, we can use it to calculate per-activity average durations as follows. Consider an RDD of key/value pairs where keys correspond to different activities and values correspond to duration.

```python
rdd = sc.parallelize([("Sleep", 7), ("Work",5), ("Play", 3), 
                      ("Sleep", 6), ("Work",4), ("Play", 4),
                      ("Sleep", 8), ("Work",5), ("Play", 5)])

sum_counts = rdd.combineByKey(
    (lambda x: (x, 1)), # createCombiner maps each value into a  combiner (or accumulator)
    (lambda acc, value: (acc[0]+value, acc[1]+1)),
#mergeValue defines how to merge a accumulator with a value (saves on mapping each value to an accumulator first)
    (lambda acc1, acc2: (acc1[0]+acc2[0], acc1[1]+acc2[1])) # combine accumulators
)

print(sum_counts.collect())
duration_means_by_activity = sum_counts.mapValues(lambda value:
                                                  value[0]*1.0/value[1]) \
                                            .collect()
print(duration_means_by_activity)

# RETURNS
# ->
"""
[('Work', (14, 3)), ('Play', (12, 3)), ('Sleep', (21, 3))]
[('Work', 4.666666666666667), ('Play', 4.0), ('Sleep', 7.0)]
"""
```


To understand combineByKey(), it’s useful to think of how it handles each element it processes. As combineByKey() traverses through the elements in a partition, each element either has a key it hasn’t seen before or has the same key as a previous element.

If it’s a new key, createCombiner() is called to create the initial value for the accumulator on that key. In the above example, the accumulator is a tuple initialized as (x, 1) where x is a value in original RDD. Note that createCombiner() is called only when a key is seen for the first time in each partition.

If it is a key we have seen before while processing that partition, it will instead use the provided function, mergeValue(), with the current value for the accumulator for that key and the new value.

Since each partition is processed independently, we can have multiple accumulators for the same key. When we are merging the results from each partition, if two or more partitions have an accumulator for the same key, we merge the accumulators using the user-supplied mergeCombiners() function. In the above example, we are just adding the 2 accumulators element-wise.

## Transformations on two (key-value) RDDs

```python
rdd1 = sc.parallelize([(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)])
rdd2 = sc.parallelize([(2,5),(3,1)])
print('rdd1=',rdd1.collect())
print('rdd2=',rdd2.collect())

# RETURNS
# ->
"""
rdd1= [(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
rdd2= [(2, 5), (3, 1)]
"""
```

1. `subtractByKey`

Remove from RDD1 all elements whose key is present in RDD2.

```python
print('rdd1=',rdd1.collect())
print('rdd2=',rdd2.collect())
print("Result:", rdd1.subtractByKey(rdd2).collect())

# RETURNS
# ->
"""
rdd1= [(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
rdd2= [(2, 5), (3, 1)]
Result: [(1, 2)]
"""
```

2. `join`

* A fundamental operation in relational databases.
* assumes two tables have a key column in common.
* merges rows with the same key.

Suppose we have `key,value` datasets

|dataset 1| |..........| dataset 2 | | |-------------|-------------------------------------| |-------------|-----------------| | key=name | (gender,occupation,age) | | key=name | hair color | | John | (male,cook,21) | | Jill | blond | | Jill | (female,programmer,19) | | Grace | brown |
| John | (male, kid, 2) | | John | black | | Kate | (female, wrestler, 54) |

When `Join` is called on datasets of type `(Key, V)` and `(Key, W)`, it returns a dataset of `(Key, (V, W))` pairs with all pairs of elements for each key. Joining the 2 datasets above yields:

|   key = name | (gender,occupation,age),haircolor |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| John         | ((male,cook,21),black)            |
| John         | ((male, kid, 2),black)            |
| Jill         | ((female,programmer,19),blond)    |

```python
print('rdd1=',rdd1.collect())
print('rdd2=',rdd2.collect())
print("Result:", rdd1.join(rdd2).collect())

# RETURNS
# ->
"""
rdd1= [(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
rdd2= [(2, 5), (3, 1)]
Result: [(2, (1, 5)), (2, (2, 5))]
"""
```

## Variants of join.
There are four variants of join which differ in how they treat keys that appear in one dataset but not the other.

* `join` is an inner join which means that keys that appear only in one dataset are eliminated.
* `leftOuterJoin` keeps all keys from the left dataset even if they don't appear in the right dataset. The result of leftOuterJoin in our example will contain the keys John, Jill, Kate
* `rightOuterJoin` keeps all keys from the right dataset even if they don't appear in the left dataset. The result of leftOuterJoin in our example will contain the keys Jill, Grace, John
* `FullOuterJoin` keeps all keys from both datasets. The result of leftOuterJoin in our example will contain the keys Jill, Grace, John, Kate

    In outer joins, if the element appears only in one dataset, the element in (K,(V,W)) that does not appear in the dataset is represented bye None

3. `rightOuterJoin`

Perform a right join between two RDDs. Every key in the right/second RDD will be present at least once.

```python
print('rdd1=',rdd1.collect())
print('rdd2=',rdd2.collect())
print("Result:", rdd1.rightOuterJoin(rdd2).collect())

# RETURNS
# ->
"""
rdd1= [(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
rdd2= [(2, 5), (3, 1)]
Result: [(2, (1, 5)), (2, (2, 5)), (3, (None, 1))]
"""
```

4. `leftOuterjoin`: Perform a left join between two RDDs. Every key in the left RDD will be present at least once.

```python
print('rdd1=',rdd1.collect())
print('rdd2=',rdd2.collect())
print("Result:", rdd1.leftOuterJoin(rdd2).collect())

# RETURNS
# ->
"""
rdd1= [(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
rdd2= [(2, 5), (3, 1)]
Result: [(1, (2, None)), (2, (1, 5)), (2, (2, 5))]
"""
```

## Actions on (key,val) RDDs

```python
rdd = sc.parallelize([(1,2), (2,4), (2,6)])
```

1. `countByKey()`

Count the number of elements for each key. Returns a dictionary for easy access to keys.

```python
print("RDD: ", rdd.collect())
result = rdd.countByKey()
print("Result:", result)

# RETURNS
# ->
"""
RDD:  [(1, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6)]
Result: defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {1: 1, 2: 2})
"""
```

2. `collectAsMap()`

Collect the result as a dictionary to provide easy lookup.

```python
print("RDD: ", rdd.collect())
result = rdd.collectAsMap()
print("Result:", result)
# RETURNS
# ->
"""
RDD:  [(1, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6)]
Result: {1: 2, 2: 6}
"""
```

3. `lookup(key)`

Return all values associated with the provided key.

```python
print("RDD: ", rdd.collect())
result = rdd.lookup(2 )
print("Result:", result)

# RETURNS
# ->
"""
RDD:  [(1, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6)]
Result: [4, 6]
"""
```
