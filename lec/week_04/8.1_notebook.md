# Review of linear algebra

This notebook is a quick review of the concepts and notation of linear algebra and their implementation in the python library `numpy`.

It is not intended as a course in linear algebra. For an excellent elementary introduction to vectors and linear algebra, see [Gilbert Strang's course on linear algebra](http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/videos.shtml)

## Vectors

* arrows
* velocity and direction
* location in the plane or in 3D space.
* many many other things.

Vectors spaces are the at the basis of linear algebra. They can be used to describe many things: from points in the plane, to time series to the configuration of electrons in an atom. This notebook is a brief review of some of the main concepts regarding vectors in finite dimensional Euclidean space.

### Vector notation

* We will denote vectors by letters with a little arrow on top: 
* Vectors are grouped by **dimension **, the set of all  dimensional (euclidean) vectors is denoted .
* A 2D vector is an element of  and **can** be described by a sequence of **two** real numbers:  or 
* The description **is not unique**, it depends on the choice of coordinates,
* A 3D vector is an element of 
described by a sequence of **three** numbers:
 or 
* A  dimensional vector is an element of  and is described by a sequence of  real numbers: 

### Lists vs Numpy Arrays

The numpy library (we will reference it by np) is the workhorse library for linear algebra in python.  To creat a vector simply surround a python list () with the np.array function:

```python
x_vector = np.array([1,2,3])
print(x_vector)
"""
RETURNS ->

[1 2 3]
"""

```

The function `np.array` converts a python list and converts it to an array:

```python
c_list = [1,2]
print("The list:",c_list)
print("Has length:", len(c_list))

c_vector = np.array(c_list)
print("The vector:", c_vector)
print("Has shape:",c_vector.shape)
"""
RETURNS ->

The list: [1, 2]
Has length: 2
The vector: [1 2]
Has shape: (2,)
"""

```

```python
z = [5,6] # a list
print("This is a list, not an array:",z)
print(type(z))
"""
RETURNS ->

This is a list, not an array: [5, 6]
<class 'list'>
"""

```

```python
zarray = np.array(z)
print("This is an array, not a list",zarray)
print(type(zarray))
"""
RETURNS ->

This is an array, not a list [5 6]
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
"""

```

### Arrays as Vectors

One way to define vectors in numpy is to use a one dimensional array.

```python
v1=np.array([1,2])
v2=np.array([-1,1])
print(v1,v2)
"""
RETURNS ->

[1 2] [-1 1]
"""

```

#### Vector dimension vs. Array dimension

The word **dimension** has two different meanings in this context.

* The array `np.array([1,2])` has **one** array dimension.
* The vector `[1,2]` has **two** vector dimensions.

We will try to use **dimension** for the vector dimension and **shape** or **index** for the array dimension.

## Operations on vectors

There are two basic operations on vectors:

1. Multiplying a vector by a scalar (a number)
2. Adding two vectors

### 1. Multiplying a vector by a scalar

Multiplying a vector  by a scalar  results in a vector in the same direction as  but of a different length.
The length is multiplied by .
If  the direction is reversed.

```python
print("v1=",v1)
print("2*v1=",2*v1)
"""
RETURNS ->

v1= [1 2]
2*v1= [2 4]
"""

```

### 2. Adding two vectors

We add vectors by adding their components:


```python
print("v1=",v1)
print("v2=",v2)
print("v1+v2=",v1+v2)
"""
RETURNS ->

v1= [1 2]
v2= [-1  1]
v1+v2= [0 3]
"""

```

#### Geometry of vector addition

Geometrically, adding  to  is equivalent to placing the tail of  on the head of . The sum is the vector from the tail of  to the head of .

## Linear Combinations

Combining the two operations, we can form **linear combinations**:


```python
3*v1-2*v2
"""
RETURNS ->

array([5, 4])
"""

```

### Span

The set of all linear combinations of a set of vectors  is called the **span** of the vectors.


Usually, the span of  vectors in  is a -dimensional subspace of .
However, if the vectors are **linearly dependent**, the dimension of the span is less than .

## Norms and Dot Products

### The Norm (Length) of a vector

The Euclidean Norm (or length) of a vector  is defined as:


```python
from numpy.linalg import norm
print("v1=",v1)
print("norm(v1)=",norm(v1))
print("sqrt(1^2+2^2)=",sqrt(1**2+2**2))
"""
RETURNS ->

v1= [1 2]
norm(v1)= 2.2360679775
sqrt(1^2+2^2)= 2.2360679775
"""

```

### The Dot Product (Inner Product)

The dot product of two vectors  is defined as:


```python
print("v1=",v1)
print("v2=",v2)
print("v1.v2=",np.dot(v1,v2))
"""
RETURNS ->

v1= [1 2]
v2= [-1  1]
v1.v2= 1
"""

```

#### Geometric interpretation

The dot product is related to the angle  between the vectors:


This implies that if two vectors are **orthogonal** (perpendicular), their dot product is 0.

```python
v_orth = np.array([2,-1])
print("v1=",v1)
print("v_orth=",v_orth)
print("dot(v1,v_orth)=",np.dot(v1,v_orth))
"""
RETURNS ->

v1= [1 2]
v_orth= [ 2 -1]
dot(v1,v_orth)= 0
"""

```

### Matrices

A matrix is a 2D array of numbers.


In numpy, we can create a matrix using `np.array` with a list of lists.

```python
A = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
print(A)
print("Shape:",A.shape)
"""
RETURNS ->

[[1 2]
 [3 4]]
Shape: (2, 2)
"""

```

#### Matrix-Vector Multiplication

We can multiply a matrix  by a vector .


This is equivalent to a linear combination of the columns of .

```python
x = np.array([1,2])
print("A=",A)
print("x=",x)
print("Ax=",np.dot(A,x))
"""
RETURNS ->

A= [[1 2]
 [3 4]]
x= [1 2]
Ax= [ 5 11]
"""

```

#### Matrix-Matrix Multiplication

We can multiply two matrices  and .



The element  is the dot product of the -th row of  and the -th column of .

```python
B = np.array([[1,0],[0,1]]) # Identity matrix
print("A=",A)
print("B=",B)
print("AB=",np.dot(A,B))
"""
RETURNS ->

A= [[1 2]
 [3 4]]
B= [[1 0]
 [0 1]]
AB= [[1 2]
 [3 4]]
"""

```

### Transpose

The transpose of a matrix , denoted , is obtained by swapping rows and columns.

```python
print("A=",A)
print("A^T=",A.T)
"""
RETURNS ->

A= [[1 2]
 [3 4]]
A^T= [[1 3]
 [2 4]]
"""

```

### Solving Linear Equations

We often want to solve the equation  for .
If  is invertible, the solution is .

```python
from numpy.linalg import inv, solve
b = np.array([5,11])
print("A=",A)
print("b=",b)
x_sol = solve(A,b)
print("solution x=",x_sol)
print("Check Ax=",np.dot(A,x_sol))
"""
RETURNS ->

A= [[1 2]
 [3 4]]
b= [ 5 11]
solution x= [1. 2.]
Check Ax= [ 5. 11.]
"""

```
