# Matrices  -----  Notation and Operations

## Matrix notation
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)">Matrix Notation</a> is a notation system that allows succinct representation of complex operations, such as a change of basis.

* **Matlab** is based on Matrix Notation.

* **Python**: similar functionality by using **numpy**

Recall that a **vector** can be represented as a one dimensional array of numbers.

A **matrix** can be represented as a two dimensional array of numbers.

Typically:
* **Vectors** are denoted by lower case letters: $x,y,a,b,\ldots$
* **Matrices** are denoted by upper case letters: $X,Y,A,B,\ldots$
* **Scalars** are denoted by greek letters: $\alpha, \sigma, \pi$

### Indices
* The $i$th element of a vector $x$ is denoted $x_i$
* The element in row $i$ and column $j$ of matrix $A$ is denoted $A_{i,j}$

### Shapes
* A vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ has $d$ elements (a.k.a. dimensions).
* A matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n,m}$ has $n$ rows and $m$ columns.

### Transpose
* The **transpose** of a vector $x$ is denoted $x^\top$ (or $x'$).
* The transpose of a row vector is a column vector and vice versa.
* The transpose of a matrix $A$ is denoted $A^\top$ and is defined by $(A^\top)_{i,j} = A_{j,i}$

```python
import numpy as np
A=np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
print('A=\n',A)
print('A.T=\n',A.T)
"""
RETURNS ->

A=
 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
A.T=
 [[1 4]
 [2 5]
 [3 6]]
"""

```

### Dot Product

The **dot product** (or **inner product**) of two vectors of the same dimension  is defined as


```python
x=np.array([1,2,3])
y=np.array([-1,0,1])
print('x=',x)
print('y=',y)
print('x.dot(y)=',x.dot(y))
"""
RETURNS ->

x= [1 2 3]
y= [-1  0  1]
x.dot(y)= 2
"""

```

### Matrix Product

The product of a matrix  and a matrix  is a matrix  defined by



Note that the number of columns of  must be equal to the number of rows of .

In numpy `A.dot(B)` or `A @ B` computes the matrix product.

```python
A=np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
B=np.array([[1,0],[0,1]])
print('A=\n',A)
print('B=\n',B)
print('A@B=\n',A@B)
"""
RETURNS ->

A=
 [[1 2]
 [3 4]]
B=
 [[1 0]
 [0 1]]
A@B=
 [[1 2]
 [3 4]]
"""

```

### Outer Product

The **outer product** of two vectors  and  is the matrix .


```python
x=np.array([1,2])
y=np.array([3,4,5])
print('x=',x)
print('y=',y)
# We need to reshape x and y to be 2D arrays to compute outer product using matrix multiplication
print('outer(x,y)=\n', np.outer(x,y))
"""
RETURNS ->

x= [1 2]
y= [3 4 5]
outer(x,y)=
 [[ 3  4  5]
 [ 6  8 10]]
"""

```

### Element-wise product

Sometimes we want to multiply elements of two matrices (or vectors) of the same shape element by element.
This is denoted by  or simply  in many programming languages.


```python
A=np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
B=np.array([[1,0],[0,1]])
print('A=\n',A)
print('B=\n',B)
print('A*B=\n',A*B)
"""
RETURNS ->

A=
 [[1 2]
 [3 4]]
B=
 [[1 0]
 [0 1]]
A*B=
 [[1 0]
 [0 4]]
"""

```

### Norms

The **Euclidean norm** (or  norm) of a vector  is defined as


```python
x=np.array([3,4])
print('x=',x)
print('norm(x)=',np.linalg.norm(x))
"""
RETURNS ->

x= [3 4]
norm(x)= 5.0
"""

```

### Special Matrices

* **Zero matrix**: Matrix of all zeros.
* **Identity matrix** (): Square matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. .
* **Diagonal matrix**: Square matrix with non-zero elements only on the diagonal.
* **Symmetric matrix**: Square matrix equal to its transpose ().

```python
print('Zeros:\n',np.zeros((2,2)))
print('Identity:\n',np.eye(2))
print('Diagonal:\n',np.diag([1,2]))
"""
RETURNS ->

Zeros:
 [[0. 0.]
 [0. 0.]]
Identity:
 [[1. 0.]
 [0. 1.]]
Diagonal:
 [[1 0]
 [0 2]]
"""

```
